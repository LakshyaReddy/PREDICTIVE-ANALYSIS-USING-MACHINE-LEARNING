# About Project
This project builds a machine learning model to predict IPL match final scores based on in-game factors. It uses team performance, overs, runs, wickets, and last 5-over stats to make predictions. The model is trained using decision trees, random forests, and neural networks and is evaluated against real match data. The trained models are saved for future predictions. Developed as part of my internship, this project highlights data analysis, regression modeling, and machine learning.
